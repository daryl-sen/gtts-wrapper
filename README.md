# gtts-wrapper

This is a GUI wrapper for the gTTS module by pndurette (https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/), created for personal use. GUI created using tkinter (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and the executable file was compiled using pyinstaller (https://www.pyinstaller.org/)

The author of this wrapper does not claim any credit for any of these modules. This is just a GUI wrapper compiled into an .exe for someone who doesn't know any python.

An internet connection is required to use gTTS.
